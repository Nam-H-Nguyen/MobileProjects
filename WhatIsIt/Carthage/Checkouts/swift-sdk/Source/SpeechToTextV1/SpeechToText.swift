/**
 The IBM&reg; Speech to Text service provides APIs that use IBM's speech-recognition capabilities to produce transcripts
 of spoken audio. The service can transcribe speech from various languages and audio formats. It addition to basic
 transcription, the service can produce detailed information about many different aspects of the audio. For most
 languages, the service supports two sampling rates, broadband and narrowband. It returns all JSON response content in
 the UTF-8 character set.
 For speech recognition, the service supports synchronous and asynchronous HTTP Representational State Transfer (REST)
 interfaces. It also supports a WebSocket interface that provides a full-duplex, low-latency communication channel:
 Clients send requests and audio to the service and receive results over a single connection asynchronously.
 The service also offers two customization interfaces. Use language model customization to expand the vocabulary of a
 base model with domain-specific terminology. Use acoustic model customization to adapt a base model for the acoustic
 characteristics of your audio. Language model customization is generally available for production use with most
 supported languages; acoustic model customization is beta functionality that is available for all supported languages.

    /**
     Recognize audio.

     Sends audio and returns transcription results for a recognition request. Returns only the final results; to enable
     interim results, use the WebSocket API. The service imposes a data size limit of 100 MB. It automatically detects
     the endianness of the incoming audio and, for audio that includes multiple channels, downmixes the audio to
     one-channel mono during transcoding.
     **See also:** [Making a basic HTTP
     request](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/http.html#HTTP-basic).
     ### Streaming mode
      For requests to transcribe live audio as it becomes available, you must set the `Transfer-Encoding` header to
     `chunked` to use streaming mode. In streaming mode, the server closes the connection (status code 408) if the
     service receives no data chunk for 30 seconds and it has no audio to transcribe for 30 seconds. The server also
     closes the connection (status code 400) if no speech is detected for `inactivity_timeout` seconds of audio (not
     processing time); use the `inactivity_timeout` parameter to change the default of 30 seconds.
     **See also:**
     * [Audio transmission](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#transmission)
     * [Timeouts](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#timeouts).
     ### Audio formats (content types)
      The service accepts audio in the following formats (MIME types).
     * For formats that are labeled **Required**, you must use the `Content-Type` header with the request to specify the
     format of the audio.
     * For all other formats, you can omit the `Content-Type` header or specify `application/octet-stream` with the
     header to have the service automatically detect the format of the audio. (With the `curl` command, you can specify
     either `\"Content-Type:\"` or `\"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\"`.)
     Where indicated, the format that you specify must include the sampling rate and can optionally include the number
     of channels and the endianness of the audio.
     * `audio/basic` (**Required.** Use only with narrowband models.)
     * `audio/flac`
     * `audio/l16` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of channels (`channels`)
     and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
     * `audio/mp3`
     * `audio/mpeg`
     * `audio/mulaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
     * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
     * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
     * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
     * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
     * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
     * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
     * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
     **See also:** [Audio formats](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).
     **Note:** You must pass a content type when using any of the Watson SDKs. The SDKs require the content-type
     parameter for all audio formats.
     ### Multipart speech recognition
      The method also supports multipart recognition requests. With multipart requests, you pass all audio data as
     multipart form data. You specify some parameters as request headers and query parameters, but you pass JSON
     metadata as form data to control most aspects of the transcription.
     The multipart approach is intended for use with browsers for which JavaScript is disabled or when the parameters
     used with the request are greater than the 8 KB limit imposed by most HTTP servers and proxies. You can encounter
     this limit, for example, if you want to spot a very large number of keywords.
     **See also:** [Making a multipart HTTP
     request](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/http.html#HTTP-multi).

     - parameter audio: The audio to transcribe.
     - parameter contentType: The type of the input.
     - parameter model: The identifier of the model that is to be used for the recognition request.
     - parameter languageCustomizationID: The customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that is to be used
       with the recognition request. The base model of the specified custom language model must match the model
       specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance
       of the service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom language model is used. See [Custom
       models](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom).
       **Note:** Use this parameter instead of the deprecated `customization_id` parameter.
     - parameter acousticCustomizationID: The customization ID (GUID) of a custom acoustic model that is to be used
       with the recognition request. The base model of the specified custom acoustic model must match the model
       specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance
       of the service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom acoustic model is used. See [Custom
       models](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom).
     - parameter baseModelVersion: The version of the specified base model that is to be used with recognition
       request. Multiple versions of a base model can exist when a model is updated for internal improvements. The
       parameter is intended primarily for use with custom models that have been upgraded for a new base model. The
       default value depends on whether the parameter is used with or without a custom model. See [Base model
       version](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#version).
     - parameter customizationWeight: If you specify the customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model with the
       recognition request, the customization weight tells the service how much weight to give to words from the custom
       language model compared to those from the base model for the current request.
       Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was specified for the custom model
       when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that
       was specified when the custom model was trained.
       The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use
       of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy
       of phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain phrases.
       See [Custom models](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom).
     - parameter inactivityTimeout: The time in seconds after which, if only silence (no speech) is detected in
       submitted audio, the connection is closed with a 400 error. The parameter is useful for stopping audio submission
       from a live microphone when a user simply walks away. Use `-1` for infinity. See
       [Timeouts](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#timeouts).
     - parameter keywords: An array of keyword strings to spot in the audio. Each keyword string can include one or
       more string tokens. Keywords are spotted only in the final results, not in interim hypotheses. If you specify any
       keywords, you must also specify a keywords threshold. You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords. Omit the parameter
       or specify an empty array if you do not need to spot keywords. See [Keyword
       spotting](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#keyword_spotting).
     - parameter keywordsThreshold: A confidence value that is the lower bound for spotting a keyword. A word is
       considered to match a keyword if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability
       between 0.0 and 1.0. No keyword spotting is performed if you omit the parameter. If you specify a threshold, you
       must also specify one or more keywords. See [Keyword
       spotting](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#keyword_spotting).
     - parameter maxAlternatives: The maximum number of alternative transcripts that the service is to return. By
       default, a single transcription is returned. See [Maximum
       alternatives](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#max_alternatives).
     - parameter wordAlternativesThreshold: A confidence value that is the lower bound for identifying a hypothesis as
       a possible word alternative (also known as \"Confusion Networks\"). An alternative word is considered if its
       confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0. No alternative
       words are computed if you omit the parameter. See [Word
       alternatives](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_alternatives).
     - parameter wordConfidence: If `true`, the service returns a confidence measure in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 for
       each word. By default, no word confidence measures are returned. See [Word
       confidence](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_confidence).
     - parameter timestamps: If `true`, the service returns time alignment for each word. By default, no timestamps
       are returned. See [Word
       timestamps](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_timestamps).
     - parameter profanityFilter: If `true`, the service filters profanity from all output except for keyword results
       by replacing inappropriate words with a series of asterisks. Set the parameter to `false` to return results with
       no censoring. Applies to US English transcription only. See [Profanity
       filtering](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#profanity_filter).
     - parameter smartFormatting: If `true`, the service converts dates, times, series of digits and numbers, phone
       numbers, currency values, and internet addresses into more readable, conventional representations in the final
       transcript of a recognition request. For US English, the service also converts certain keyword strings to
       punctuation symbols. By default, no smart formatting is performed. Applies to US English and Spanish
       transcription only. See [Smart
       formatting](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#smart_formatting).
     - parameter speakerLabels: If `true`, the response includes labels that identify which words were spoken by which
       participants in a multi-person exchange. By default, no speaker labels are returned. Setting `speaker_labels` to
       `true` forces the `timestamps` parameter to be `true`, regardless of whether you specify `false` for the
       parameter. To determine whether a language model supports speaker labels, use the **Get models** method and check
       that the attribute `speaker_labels` is set to `true`. See [Speaker
       labels](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#speaker_labels).
     - parameter customizationID: **Deprecated.** Use the `language_customization_id` parameter to specify the
       customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that is to be used with the recognition request. Do not
       specify both parameters with a request.
     - parameter headers: A dictionary of request headers to be sent with this request.
     - parameter failure: A function executed if an error occurs.
     - parameter success: A function executed with the successful result.

    /**
     Register a callback.

     Registers a callback URL with the service for use with subsequent asynchronous recognition requests. The service
     attempts to register, or white-list, the callback URL if it is not already registered by sending a `GET` request to
     the callback URL. The service passes a random alphanumeric challenge string via the `challenge_string` parameter of
     the request. The request includes an `Accept` header that specifies `text/plain` as the required response type.
     To be registered successfully, the callback URL must respond to the `GET` request from the service. The response
     must send status code 200 and must include the challenge string in its body. Set the `Content-Type` response header
     to `text/plain`. Upon receiving this response, the service responds to the original registration request with
     response code 201.
     The service sends only a single `GET` request to the callback URL. If the service does not receive a reply with a
     response code of 200 and a body that echoes the challenge string sent by the service within five seconds, it does
     not white-list the URL; it instead sends status code 400 in response to the **Register a callback** request. If the
     requested callback URL is already white-listed, the service responds to the initial registration request with
     response code 200.
     If you specify a user secret with the request, the service uses it as a key to calculate an HMAC-SHA1 signature of
     the challenge string in its response to the `POST` request. It sends this signature in the `X-Callback-Signature`
     header of its `GET` request to the URL during registration. It also uses the secret to calculate a signature over
     the payload of every callback notification that uses the URL. The signature provides authentication and data
     integrity for HTTP communications.
     After you successfully register a callback URL, you can use it with an indefinite number of recognition requests.
     You can register a maximum of 20 callback URLS in a one-hour span of time.
     **See also:** [Registering a callback
     URL](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/async.html#register).

     - parameter callbackUrl: An HTTP or HTTPS URL to which callback notifications are to be sent. To be white-listed,
       the URL must successfully echo the challenge string during URL verification. During verification, the client can
       also check the signature that the service sends in the `X-Callback-Signature` header to verify the origin of the
       request.
     - parameter userSecret: A user-specified string that the service uses to generate the HMAC-SHA1 signature that it
       sends via the `X-Callback-Signature` header. The service includes the header during URL verification and with
       every notification sent to the callback URL. It calculates the signature over the payload of the notification. If
       you omit the parameter, the service does not send the header.
     - parameter headers: A dictionary of request headers to be sent with this request.
     - parameter failure: A function executed if an error occurs.
     - parameter success: A function executed with the successful result.

    /**
     Create a job.

     Creates a job for a new asynchronous recognition request. The job is owned by the user whose service credentials
     are used to create it. How you learn the status and results of a job depends on the parameters you include with the
     job creation request:
     * By callback notification: Include the `callback_url` parameter to specify a URL to which the service is to send
     callback notifications when the status of the job changes. Optionally, you can also include the `events` and
     `user_token` parameters to subscribe to specific events and to specify a string that is to be included with each
     notification for the job.
     * By polling the service: Omit the `callback_url`, `events`, and `user_token` parameters. You must then use the
     **Check jobs** or **Check a job** methods to check the status of the job, using the latter to retrieve the results
     when the job is complete.
     The two approaches are not mutually exclusive. You can poll the service for job status or obtain results from the
     service manually even if you include a callback URL. In both cases, you can include the `results_ttl` parameter to
     specify how long the results are to remain available after the job is complete. Using the HTTPS **Check a job**
     method to retrieve results is more secure than receiving them via callback notification over HTTP because it
     provides confidentiality in addition to authentication and data integrity.
     The method supports the same basic parameters as other HTTP and WebSocket recognition requests. It also supports
     the following parameters specific to the asynchronous interface:
     * `callback_url`
     * `events`
     * `user_token`
     * `results_ttl`
     The service imposes a data size limit of 100 MB. It automatically detects the endianness of the incoming audio and,
     for audio that includes multiple channels, downmixes the audio to one-channel mono during transcoding.
     **See also:** [Creating a job](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/async.html#create).
     ### Streaming mode
      For requests to transcribe live audio as it becomes available, you must set the `Transfer-Encoding` header to
     `chunked` to use streaming mode. In streaming mode, the server closes the connection (status code 408) if the
     service receives no data chunk for 30 seconds and it has no audio to transcribe for 30 seconds. The server also
     closes the connection (status code 400) if no speech is detected for `inactivity_timeout` seconds of audio (not
     processing time); use the `inactivity_timeout` parameter to change the default of 30 seconds.
     **See also:**
     * [Audio transmission](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#transmission)
     * [Timeouts](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#timeouts)
     ### Audio formats (content types)
      The service accepts audio in the following formats (MIME types).
     * For formats that are labeled **Required**, you must use the `Content-Type` header with the request to specify the
     format of the audio.
     * For all other formats, you can omit the `Content-Type` header or specify `application/octet-stream` with the
     header to have the service automatically detect the format of the audio. (With the `curl` command, you can specify
     either `\"Content-Type:\"` or `\"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\"`.)
     Where indicated, the format that you specify must include the sampling rate and can optionally include the number
     of channels and the endianness of the audio.
     * `audio/basic` (**Required.** Use only with narrowband models.)
     * `audio/flac`
     * `audio/l16` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of channels (`channels`)
     and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
     * `audio/mp3`
     * `audio/mpeg`
     * `audio/mulaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
     * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
     * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
     * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
     * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
     * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
     * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
     * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
     **See also:** [Audio formats](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).
     **Note:** You must pass a content type when using any of the Watson SDKs. The SDKs require the content-type
     parameter for all audio formats.

     - parameter audio: The audio to transcribe.
     - parameter contentType: The type of the input.
     - parameter model: The identifier of the model that is to be used for the recognition request.
     - parameter callbackUrl: A URL to which callback notifications are to be sent. The URL must already be
       successfully white-listed by using the **Register a callback** method. You can include the same callback URL with
       any number of job creation requests. Omit the parameter to poll the service for job completion and results.
       Use the `user_token` parameter to specify a unique user-specified string with each job to differentiate the
       callback notifications for the jobs.
     - parameter events: If the job includes a callback URL, a comma-separated list of notification events to which to
       subscribe. Valid events are
       * `recognitions.started` generates a callback notification when the service begins to process the job.
       * `recognitions.completed` generates a callback notification when the job is complete. You must use the **Check a
       job** method to retrieve the results before they time out or are deleted.
       * `recognitions.completed_with_results` generates a callback notification when the job is complete. The
       notification includes the results of the request.
       * `recognitions.failed` generates a callback notification if the service experiences an error while processing
       the job.
       The `recognitions.completed` and `recognitions.completed_with_results` events are incompatible. You can specify
       only of the two events.
       If the job includes a callback URL, omit the parameter to subscribe to the default events:
       `recognitions.started`, `recognitions.completed`, and `recognitions.failed`. If the job does not include a
       callback URL, omit the parameter.
     - parameter userToken: If the job includes a callback URL, a user-specified string that the service is to include
       with each callback notification for the job; the token allows the user to maintain an internal mapping between
       jobs and notification events. If the job does not include a callback URL, omit the parameter.
     - parameter resultsTtl: The number of minutes for which the results are to be available after the job has
       finished. If not delivered via a callback, the results must be retrieved within this time. Omit the parameter to
       use a time to live of one week. The parameter is valid with or without a callback URL.
     - parameter languageCustomizationID: The customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that is to be used
       with the recognition request. The base model of the specified custom language model must match the model
       specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance
       of the service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom language model is used. See [Custom
       models](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom).
       **Note:** Use this parameter instead of the deprecated `customization_id` parameter.
     - parameter acousticCustomizationID: The customization ID (GUID) of a custom acoustic model that is to be used
       with the recognition request. The base model of the specified custom acoustic model must match the model
       specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance
       of the service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom acoustic model is used. See [Custom
       models](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom).
     - parameter baseModelVersion: The version of the specified base model that is to be used with recognition
       request. Multiple versions of a base model can exist when a model is updated for internal improvements. The
       parameter is intended primarily for use with custom models that have been upgraded for a new base model. The
       default value depends on whether the parameter is used with or without a custom model. See [Base model
       version](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#version).
     - parameter customizationWeight: If you specify the customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model with the
       recognition request, the customization weight tells the service how much weight to give to words from the custom
       language model compared to those from the base model for the current request.
       Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was specified for the custom model
       when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that
       was specified when the custom model was trained.
       The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use
       of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy
       of phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain phrases.
       See [Custom models](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom).
     - parameter inactivityTimeout: The time in seconds after which, if only silence (no speech) is detected in
       submitted audio, the connection is closed with a 400 error. The parameter is useful for stopping audio submission
       from a live microphone when a user simply walks away. Use `-1` for infinity. See
       [Timeouts](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#timeouts).
     - parameter keywords: An array of keyword strings to spot in the audio. Each keyword string can include one or
       more string tokens. Keywords are spotted only in the final results, not in interim hypotheses. If you specify any
       keywords, you must also specify a keywords threshold. You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords. Omit the parameter
       or specify an empty array if you do not need to spot keywords. See [Keyword
       spotting](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#keyword_spotting).
     - parameter keywordsThreshold: A confidence value that is the lower bound for spotting a keyword. A word is
       considered to match a keyword if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability
       between 0.0 and 1.0. No keyword spotting is performed if you omit the parameter. If you specify a threshold, you
       must also specify one or more keywords. See [Keyword
       spotting](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#keyword_spotting).
     - parameter maxAlternatives: The maximum number of alternative transcripts that the service is to return. By
       default, a single transcription is returned. See [Maximum
       alternatives](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#max_alternatives).
     - parameter wordAlternativesThreshold: A confidence value that is the lower bound for identifying a hypothesis as
       a possible word alternative (also known as \"Confusion Networks\"). An alternative word is considered if its
       confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0. No alternative
       words are computed if you omit the parameter. See [Word
       alternatives](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_alternatives).
     - parameter wordConfidence: If `true`, the service returns a confidence measure in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 for
       each word. By default, no word confidence measures are returned. See [Word
       confidence](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_confidence).
     - parameter timestamps: If `true`, the service returns time alignment for each word. By default, no timestamps
       are returned. See [Word
       timestamps](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_timestamps).
     - parameter profanityFilter: If `true`, the service filters profanity from all output except for keyword results
       by replacing inappropriate words with a series of asterisks. Set the parameter to `false` to return results with
       no censoring. Applies to US English transcription only. See [Profanity
       filtering](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#profanity_filter).
     - parameter smartFormatting: If `true`, the service converts dates, times, series of digits and numbers, phone
       numbers, currency values, and internet addresses into more readable, conventional representations in the final
       transcript of a recognition request. For US English, the service also converts certain keyword strings to
       punctuation symbols. By default, no smart formatting is performed. Applies to US English and Spanish
       transcription only. See [Smart
       formatting](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#smart_formatting).
     - parameter speakerLabels: If `true`, the response includes labels that identify which words were spoken by which
       participants in a multi-person exchange. By default, no speaker labels are returned. Setting `speaker_labels` to
       `true` forces the `timestamps` parameter to be `true`, regardless of whether you specify `false` for the
       parameter. To determine whether a language model supports speaker labels, use the **Get models** method and check
       that the attribute `speaker_labels` is set to `true`. See [Speaker
       labels](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#speaker_labels).
     - parameter customizationID: **Deprecated.** Use the `language_customization_id` parameter to specify the
       customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that is to be used with the recognition request. Do not
       specify both parameters with a request.
     - parameter headers: A dictionary of request headers to be sent with this request.
     - parameter failure: A function executed if an error occurs.
     - parameter success: A function executed with the successful result.

     Train a custom language model.

     Initiates the training of a custom language model with new corpora, custom words, or both. After adding, modifying,

     on the latest data. You can specify whether the custom language model is to be trained with all words from its
     words resource or only with words that were added or modified by the user. You must use credentials for the
     instance of the service that owns a model to train it.
     The training method is asynchronous. It can take on the order of minutes to complete depending on the amount of
     data on which the service is being trained and the current load on the service. The method returns an HTTP 200
     response code to indicate that the training process has begun.
     You can monitor the status of the training by using the **Get a custom language model** method to poll the model's
     status. Use a loop to check the status every 10 seconds. The method returns a `LanguageModel` object that includes
     `status` and `progress` fields. A status of `available` means that the custom model is trained and ready to use.
     The service cannot accept subsequent training requests, or requests to add new corpora or words, until the existing
     request completes.
     Training can fail to start for the following reasons:
     * The service is currently handling another request for the custom model, such as another training request or a
     request to add a corpus or words to the model.
     * No training data (corpora or words) have been added to the custom model.
     * One or more words that were added to the custom model have invalid sounds-like pronunciations that you must fix.

     model](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/language-create.html#trainModel).

     - parameter customizationID: The customization ID (GUID) of the custom language model that is to be used for the
       request. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the
       custom model.
     - parameter wordTypeToAdd: The type of words from the custom language model's words resource on which to train
       the model:
       * `all` (the default) trains the model on all new words, regardless of whether they were extracted from corpora
       or were added or modified by the user.
       * `user` trains the model only on new words that were added or modified by the user; the model is not trained on
       new words extracted from corpora.
     - parameter customizationWeight: Specifies a customization weight for the custom language model. The
       customization weight tells the service how much weight to give to words from the custom language model compared
       to those from the base model for speech recognition. Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0; the default is 0.3.
       The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use
       of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy
       of phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain phrases.
       The value that you assign is used for all recognition requests that use the model. You can override it for any
       recognition request by specifying a customization weight for that request.
     - parameter headers: A dictionary of request headers to be sent with this request.
     - parameter failure: A function executed if an error occurs.
     - parameter success: A function executed with the successful result.

     Upgrade a custom language model.

     Initiates the upgrade of a custom language model to the latest version of its base language model. The upgrade
     method is asynchronous. It can take on the order of minutes to complete depending on the amount of data in the
     custom model and the current load on the service. A custom model must be in the `ready` or `available` state to be
     upgraded. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to upgrade it.
     The method returns an HTTP 200 response code to indicate that the upgrade process has begun successfully. You can
     monitor the status of the upgrade by using the **Get a custom language model** method to poll the model's status.
     The method returns a `LanguageModel` object that includes `status` and `progress` fields. Use a loop to check the
     status every 10 seconds. While it is being upgraded, the custom model has the status `upgrading`. When the upgrade
     is complete, the model resumes the status that it had prior to upgrade. The service cannot accept subsequent
     requests for the model until the upgrade completes.

    /**
     Add a corpus.

     Adds a single corpus text file of new training data to a custom language model. Use multiple requests to submit
     multiple corpus text files. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add a
     corpus to it. Adding a corpus does not affect the custom language model until you train the model for the new data
     by using the **Train a custom language model** method.
     Submit a plain text file that contains sample sentences from the domain of interest to enable the service to
     extract words in context. The more sentences you add that represent the context in which speakers use words from
     the domain, the better the service's recognition accuracy.
     The call returns an HTTP 201 response code if the corpus is valid. The service then asynchronously processes the
     contents of the corpus and automatically extracts new words that it finds. This can take on the order of a minute
     or two to complete depending on the total number of words and the number of new words in the corpus, as well as the
     current load on the service. You cannot submit requests to add additional corpora or words to the custom model, or
     to train the model, until the service's analysis of the corpus for the current request completes. Use the **List a
     corpus** method to check the status of the analysis.
     The service auto-populates the model's words resource with any word that is not found in its base vocabulary; these
     are referred to as out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. You can use the **List custom words** method to examine the words
     resource, using other words method to eliminate typos and modify how words are pronounced as needed.
     To add a corpus file that has the same name as an existing corpus, set the `allow_overwrite` parameter to `true`;
     otherwise, the request fails. Overwriting an existing corpus causes the service to process the corpus text file and
     extract OOV words anew. Before doing so, it removes any OOV words associated with the existing corpus from the
     model's words resource unless they were also added by another corpus or they have been modified in some way with
     the **Add custom words** or **Add a custom word** method.
     The service limits the overall amount of data that you can add to a custom model to a maximum of 10 million total
     words from all corpora combined. Also, you can add no more than 30 thousand custom (OOV) words to a model; this
     includes words that the service extracts from corpora and words that you add directly.

       request. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the
       custom model.
     - parameter corpusName: The name of the new corpus for the custom language model. Use a localized name that
       matches the language of the custom model and reflects the contents of the corpus.
       * Include a maximum of 128 characters in the name.
       * Do not include spaces, slashes, or backslashes in the name.
       * Do not use the name of a corpus that has already been added to the custom model.
       * Do not use the name `user`, which is reserved by the service to denote custom words that are added or modified
       by the user.
     - parameter corpusFile: A plain text file that contains the training data for the corpus. Encode the file in
       UTF-8 if it contains non-ASCII characters; the service assumes UTF-8 encoding if it encounters non-ASCII
       characters. With the `curl` command, use the `--data-binary` option to upload the file for the request.
     - parameter allowOverwrite: If `true`, the specified corpus or audio resource overwrites an existing corpus or
       audio resource with the same name. If `false`, the request fails if a corpus or audio resource with the same name
       already exists. The parameter has no effect if a corpus or audio resource with the same name does not already
       exist.

     List custom words.

     Lists information about custom words from a custom language model. You can list all words from the custom model's
     words resource, only custom words that were added or modified by the user, or only out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words
     that were extracted from corpora. You can also indicate the order in which the service is to return words; by
     default, words are listed in ascending alphabetical order. You must use credentials for the instance of the service
     that owns a model to query information about its words.
     **See also:** [Listing words from a custom language
     model](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/language-words.html#listWords).

     - parameter customizationID: The customization ID (GUID) of the custom language model that is to be used for the
       request. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the
       custom model.
     - parameter wordType: The type of words to be listed from the custom language model's words resource:
       * `all` (the default) shows all words.
       * `user` shows only custom words that were added or modified by the user.
       * `corpora` shows only OOV that were extracted from corpora.
     - parameter sort: Indicates the order in which the words are to be listed, `alphabetical` or by `count`. You can
       prepend an optional `+` or `-` to an argument to indicate whether the results are to be sorted in ascending or
       descending order. By default, words are sorted in ascending alphabetical order. For alphabetical ordering, the
       lexicographical precedence is numeric values, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. For count ordering,
       values with the same count are ordered alphabetically. With the `curl` command, URL encode the `+` symbol as
       `%2B`.
     - parameter headers: A dictionary of request headers to be sent with this request.
     - parameter failure: A function executed if an error occurs.
     - parameter success: A function executed with the successful result.

    /**
     Add custom words.

     Adds one or more custom words to a custom language model. The service populates the words resource for a custom
     model with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words found in each corpus added to the model. You can use this method to add
     additional words or to modify existing words in the words resource. The words resource for a model can contain a
     maximum of 30 thousand custom (OOV) words, including words that the service extracts from corpora and words that
     you add directly.
     You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add or modify custom words for the
     model. Adding or modifying custom words does not affect the custom model until you train the model for the new data
     by using the **Train a custom language model** method.
     You add custom words by providing a `CustomWords` object, which is an array of `CustomWord` objects, one per word.
     You must use the object's `word` parameter to identify the word that is to be added. You can also provide one or
     both of the optional `sounds_like` and `display_as` fields for each word.
     * The `sounds_like` field provides an array of one or more pronunciations for the word. Use the parameter to
     specify how the word can be pronounced by users. Use the parameter for words that are difficult to pronounce,
     foreign words, acronyms, and so on. For example, you might specify that the word `IEEE` can sound like `i triple
     e`. You can specify a maximum of five sounds-like pronunciations for a word.
     * The `display_as` field provides a different way of spelling the word in a transcript. Use the parameter when you
     want the word to appear different from its usual representation or from its spelling in corpora training data. For
     example, you might indicate that the word `IBM(trademark)` is to be displayed as `IBM&trade;`.
     If you add a custom word that already exists in the words resource for the custom model, the new definition
     overwrites the existing data for the word. If the service encounters an error with the input data, it returns a
     failure code and does not add any of the words to the words resource.
     The call returns an HTTP 201 response code if the input data is valid. It then asynchronously processes the words
     to add them to the model's words resource. The time that it takes for the analysis to complete depends on the
     number of new words that you add but is generally faster than adding a corpus or training a model.
     You can monitor the status of the request by using the **List a custom language model** method to poll the model's
     status. Use a loop to check the status every 10 seconds. The method returns a `Customization` object that includes
     a `status` field. A status of `ready` means that the words have been added to the custom model. The service cannot
     accept requests to add new corpora or words or to train the model until the existing request completes.
     You can use the **List custom words** or **List a custom word** method to review the words that you add. Words with
     an invalid `sounds_like` field include an `error` field that describes the problem. You can use other words-related
     methods to correct errors, eliminate typos, and modify how words are pronounced as needed.

     Train a custom acoustic model.

     Initiates the training of a custom acoustic model with new or changed audio resources. After adding or deleting
     audio resources for a custom acoustic model, use this method to begin the actual training of the model on the
     latest audio data. The custom acoustic model does not reflect its changed data until you train it. You must use
     credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to train it.
     The training method is asynchronous. It can take on the order of minutes or hours to complete depending on the
     total amount of audio data on which the custom acoustic model is being trained and the current load on the service.
     Typically, training a custom acoustic model takes approximately two to four times the length of its audio data. The
     range of time depends on the model being trained and the nature of the audio, such as whether the audio is clean or
     noisy. The method returns an HTTP 200 response code to indicate that the training process has begun.
     You can monitor the status of the training by using the **Get a custom acoustic model** method to poll the model's
     status. Use a loop to check the status once a minute. The method returns an `AcousticModel` object that includes
     `status` and `progress` fields. A status of `available` indicates that the custom model is trained and ready to
     use. The service cannot accept subsequent training requests, or requests to add new audio resources, until the
     existing request completes.
     You can use the optional `custom_language_model_id` parameter to specify the GUID of a separately created custom
     language model that is to be used during training. Specify a custom language model if you have verbatim
     transcriptions of the audio files that you have added to the custom model or you have either corpora (text files)
     or a list of words that are relevant to the contents of the audio files. For more information, see the **Create a
     custom language model** method.
     Training can fail to start for the following reasons:
     * The service is currently handling another request for the custom model, such as another training request or a
     request to add audio resources to the model.
     * The custom model contains less than 10 minutes or more than 50 hours of audio data.
     * One or more of the custom model's audio resources is invalid.
     **See also:** [Train the custom acoustic
     model](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/acoustic-create.html#trainModel).

     - parameter customizationID: The customization ID (GUID) of the custom acoustic model that is to be used for the
       request. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the
       custom model.

     audio or archive file. But the addition of one audio resource must be fully complete before you can add another.
     You must add a minimum of 10 minutes and a maximum of 50 hours of audio that includes speech, not just silence, to
     a custom acoustic model before you can train it. No audio resource, audio- or archive-type, can be larger than 100
     MB. To add an audio resource that has the same name as an existing audio resource, set the `allow_overwrite`
     parameter to `true`; otherwise, the request fails.
     The method is asynchronous. It can take several seconds to complete depending on the duration of the audio and, in
     the case of an archive file, the total number of audio files being processed. The service returns a 201 response
     code if the audio is valid. It then asynchronously analyzes the contents of the audio file or files and
     automatically extracts information about the audio such as its length, sampling rate, and encoding. You cannot
     submit requests to add additional audio resources to a custom acoustic model, or to train the model, until the
     service's analysis of all audio files for the current request completes.
     To determine the status of the service's analysis of the audio, use the **Get an audio resource** method to poll
     the status of the audio. The method accepts the customization ID of the custom model and the name of the audio
     resource, and it returns the status of the resource. Use a loop to check the status of the audio every few seconds
     until it becomes `ok`.
     **See also:** [Add audio to the custom acoustic
     model](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/acoustic-create.html#addAudio).
     ### Content types for audio-type resources
      You can add an individual audio file in any format that the service supports for speech recognition. For an
     audio-type resource, use the `Content-Type` parameter to specify the audio format (MIME type) of the audio file,
     including specifying the sampling rate, channels, and endianness where indicated.
     * `audio/basic` (Use only with narrowband models.)
     * `audio/flac`
     * `audio/l16` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of channels (`channels`) and endianness
     (`endianness`) of the audio.)
     * `audio/mp3`
     * `audio/mpeg`
     * `audio/mulaw` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
     * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
     * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
     * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
     * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
     * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
     * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
     * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
     **See also:** [Audio formats](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).
     **Note:** The sampling rate of an audio file must match the sampling rate of the base model for the custom model:
     for broadband models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband models, at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is
     higher than the minimum required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate. If the sampling
     rate of the audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the service labels the audio file as `invalid`.
     ### Content types for archive-type resources
      You can add an archive file (**.zip** or **.tar.gz** file) that contains audio files in any format that the
     service supports for speech recognition. For an archive-type resource, use the `Content-Type` parameter to specify
     the media type of the archive file:
     * `application/zip` for a **.zip** file
     * `application/gzip` for a **.tar.gz** file.
     All audio files contained in the archive must have the same audio format. Use the `Contained-Content-Type`
     parameter to specify the format of the contained audio files. The parameter accepts all of the audio formats
     supported for use with speech recognition and with the `Content-Type` header, including the `rate`, `channels`, and
     `endianness` parameters that are used with some formats. The default contained audio format is `audio/wav`.
     ### Naming restrictions for embedded audio files
      The name of an audio file that is embedded within an archive-type resource must meet the following restrictions:
     * Include a maximum of 128 characters in the file name; this includes the file extension.
     * Do not include spaces, slashes, or backslashes in the file name.
     * Do not use the name of an audio file that has already been added to the custom model as part of an archive-type
     resource.

     - parameter customizationID: The customization ID (GUID) of the custom acoustic model that is to be used for the
       request. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the
       custom model.
     - parameter audioName: The name of the new audio resource for the custom acoustic model. Use a localized name
       that matches the language of the custom model and reflects the contents of the resource.
       * Include a maximum of 128 characters in the name.
       * Do not include spaces, slashes, or backslashes in the name.
       * Do not use the name of an audio resource that has already been added to the custom model.
     - parameter audioResource: The audio resource that is to be added to the custom acoustic model, an individual
       audio file or an archive file.
     - parameter contentType: The type of the input.
     - parameter containedContentType: For an archive-type resource, specifies the format of the audio files contained
       in the archive file. The parameter accepts all of the audio formats supported for use with speech recognition,
       including the `rate`, `channels`, and `endianness` parameters that are used with some formats. For a complete
       list of supported audio formats, see [Audio formats](/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#formats).
     - parameter allowOverwrite: If `true`, the specified corpus or audio resource overwrites an existing corpus or
       audio resource with the same name. If `false`, the request fails if a corpus or audio resource with the same name
       already exists. The parameter has no effect if a corpus or audio resource with the same name does not already
       exist.
     - parameter headers: A dictionary of request headers to be sent with this request.
     - parameter failure: A function executed if an error occurs.
     - parameter success: A function executed with the successful result.
